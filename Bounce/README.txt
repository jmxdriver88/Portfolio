ABSTRACT: Bounce is a program I wrote to emulate the two-dimensional physics of a ball bouncing, given different variables such as acceleration due to gravity, horizontal velocity, initial height, and the percentage of energy the ball retains in each bounce.

USE: Program use is simple and fairly self-explanatory: Fill in the labeled fields with values you want (for example, if you want the ball to bounce higher each time, try setting the Energy Retention field to something greater than 100, like 120!) Once you have everything set, click Start and watch the drama unfold. Stop does what you would expect it to do. Reset fills the fields with their initial values.
