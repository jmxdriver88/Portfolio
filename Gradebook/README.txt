ABSTRACT: I wrote Gradebook for a Java-class lab project. It is a simple, text-based program that allows the user to store a 'gradebook', a list of grades in a text-file, view the data using a text-based graphical representation, and manipulate the data using statistical methods. 

REQUIREMENTS: These class files need to be compiled into some form of executable. (Recommend using Eclipse).

STARTING FILE: 'DataCenter.java'

USE: The program provides instructions for the user as he deals with the grades, prompting for various inputs and displaying the corresponding outputs.

Here are all the commands the user may enter:

 - 'help' for help.
 - 'avg' to see the average grade.
 - 'dev' to see the standard deviation of the grades.
 - 'max' to see the highest grade.
 - 'min' to see the lowest grade.
 - 'range' to see the range of the grades.
 - 'graph' to see the grades visually graphed.
 - 'print' to see the grades in table form.
 - 'sort:asc' to sort the grades from lowest to highest.
 - 'sort:desc' to sort the grades from highest to lowest.
 - (an integer) to see information for the student at
       that index
 - 'quit' to quit.
