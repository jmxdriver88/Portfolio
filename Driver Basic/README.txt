ABSTRACT: Driver Basic is an extremely simple programming language that I built. To learn the commands and syntax, go ahead and open the manual (manual/index.php) I wrote.

REQUIREMENTS: This program requires the use of a PHP server.

DISCLAIMER: I wrote this program on an older version of PHP than what is current, so while it ought to work correctly, I reserve the right to make no guarantees about its reliability.

STARTING FILE: index.php

USE: This program essentially is, by a very loose definition of the word, a compiler or a translator of DBS scripts found in the projects directory. By opening index.php under a PHP server, you will be presented with a list of code files in the projects directory (there are two sample files: test1 and test2). Clicking on any file will execute that script and display the results to your browser window. Enjoy your code scripting!
